# NLP_Entity-Recognition using ELMO

Named Entity Recognition Seeks to locate and classify named entity mentions in unstructured text into pre-defined categories such as:    
the person names, organizations, locations, medical codes, time expressions, quantities, monetary values, percentages, etc    

Named Entity Recognition is a pre-defined list of entities learned by the AI model     
 
 Uses Elmo + Bi-directional LSTM      
 
 Used existing machine learning models provided by TensorFlowHub via transfer learning
