# NLP_Entity-Recognition using ELMO
1)  Named Entity Recognition is a pre-defined list of entities learned by the AI model
 
2)  Named Entity Recognition Seeks to locate and classify named entity mentions in unstructured text into pre-defined categories such as:    
 the person names, organizations, locations, medical codes, time expressions, quantities, monetary values, percentages, etc    

3)  Used pretrained machine learning models provided by TensorFlowHub via transfer learning        
 
4)  ELMo embeddings are learned from the internal state of a bidirectional LSTM and represent contextual features of the input text. Itâ€™s been shown to outperform GloVe and Word2Vec embeddings on a wide variety of NLP tasks.
 
 Uses Elmo + Bi-directional LSTM
